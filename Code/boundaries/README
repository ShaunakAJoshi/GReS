IMPORTANT:
If both Neumann and Dirichlet Boundary conditions are applied to a dof, Newton Raphson may not converge.

Scenario 1: 
Neumann before Dirichlet -> OK
Dirichlet BC simply overwrites the rhs value modified after Neumann BCs. The problem is well posed

Scenario 2:
Dirichlet before Neuman -> NOT OK
Dirichlet BC are enforced modifying the linear system, such that for each dirichlet dof the new equation is:

u_d = dir_val

If Neumann BCs is then applied, we are left with:

u_d = dir_val + neu_val;

which does not make sense and  produces a wrong residual after the first iteration of Newton-Raphson.

Right now, the code does not handle this situation, since BCs are applied according to the alphabetical order 
their names, due to the keys properties of container.map in matlab.
