% testing integration on slave elements that are only partially included in
% the master support

% A finer integration is typically employed to reduce the error associated
% with strong discontinuities of the integrand
% With RBF, we can cheaply employ a more robust integration strategy for
% the boundary elements. Midpoint rule with high number of points
